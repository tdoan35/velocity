2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify integration with Vercel AI SDK endpoints
   - Test message persistence in Supabase database
   - Validate streaming responses end-to-end
   - Test error handling with simulated API failures
   - Verify authentication and authorization flows

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark streaming performance with different message sizes
   - Test concurrent chat sessions for memory leaks
   - Measure and optimize render performance for long conversations
   - Test connection recovery after network interruptions

   - Verify mobile browser compatibility
   - Test with different browser settings (cookies, JavaScript)

7. **Security Testing**
   - Validate input sanitization for user messages
   - Test rate limiting and abuse prevention
   - Verify proper handling of sensitive information
   - Test authentication token management

## 2. Implement Context-Aware Hover Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Develop a system to detect user hover interactions with UI elements and determine the appropriate guidance context
### Details:
Create a hover detection system that tracks mouse position and identifies UI elements being hovered. Implement event listeners for mouse movements and hover states. Build a context mapping system that associates UI elements with specific guidance content. Include debounce functionality to prevent rapid context switching.

## 3. Develop Content Management System for Guidance Text [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Create a system to manage and deliver contextual guidance content based on user workflow state and interactions
### Details:
Implement a content management system that stores guidance text for different UI elements and workflow states. Create a content retrieval API that returns appropriate guidance based on context. Include support for markdown formatting in guidance content. Implement content prioritization logic for complex UI states with multiple potential guidance points.

## 4. Integrate Card with Project Design Page Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3
### Description: Integrate the Smart Onboarding Card with the Project Design page workflow states and user interaction patterns
### Details:
Add the Smart Onboarding Card component to the Project Design page layout. Connect the card to the workflow state management system to display relevant guidance based on current project state. Implement logic to show/hide the card based on user experience level and current task complexity. Create hooks to update card content when workflow state changes.
<info added on 2025-08-13T23:58:29.231Z>
Refer to docs/feature-plans/smart-onboarding-text-card.md Section 4 (Integration Points) for exact placement code after line 918 in ProjectDesign.tsx, data-onboarding-id attribute additions to agent cards (lines 810-917), and the HoverContextProvider wrapper implementation in Section 6.

## 5. Implement Card Animation and Transition Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.4
### Description: Add smooth animations and transitions for card appearance, content changes, and dismissal
### Details:
Implement entrance and exit animations for the card using CSS transitions or a library like Framer Motion. Add content transition effects when guidance text changes. Create subtle highlight animations to draw attention to the card when new guidance is available. Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts.
<info added on 2025-08-13T23:58:38.936Z>
Refer to docs/feature-plans/smart-onboarding-text-card.md Section 5 (Smart Text Card Component) for Framer Motion AnimatePresence implementation with initial, animate, and exit states, motion.div transitions with key-based animations, and specific transition duration and easing configurations.

## 6. Develop User Preference and Dismissal System [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.4
### Description: Create functionality for users to customize guidance level, dismiss cards, and manage their onboarding experience
### Details:
Implement user preference storage for onboarding guidance level (beginner, intermediate, expert). Create dismissal controls that allow temporary or permanent hiding of specific guidance cards. Add a system to track which guidance has been shown and dismissed to avoid repetition. Implement a reset option for users to restore all guidance if needed.

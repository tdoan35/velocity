The problem occurs when the delete operation removes content but the insert operation fails or is delayed, leaving the editor in an inconsistent state. The investigation report identified this as Issue #3 (State Synchronization Issues) where separate operations can be interrupted by re-renders or competing state updates. The ContentDndProvider implementation from the implementation plan demonstrates proper atomic operations using TipTap's transaction system to bundle both delete and insert operations into a single atomic transaction, ensuring the editor state remains consistent throughout the move operation.\n</info added on 2025-08-14T20:26:30.505Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-14T20:34:49.337Z>\nFIRST: Read docs/drag-drop-investigation-report.md section 3 (State Synchronization Issues) focusing on the non-atomic operations bug, and docs/implementation-plans/dnd-kit-refactoring-plan.md Phase 2.3 for ContentDndProvider atomic transaction examples.\n</info added on 2025-08-14T20:34:49.337Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-14T20:57:13.075Z>\nStarted examining EnhancedBlockControls component for native drag handler identification and replacement planning.

anonKey: string }) => Promise<void>;\n     disconnectSupabase: () => Promise<void>;\n     testConnection: () => Promise<boolean>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Performance Optimization**\n   - Implement connection caching to minimize validation calls\n   - Optimize connection testing to complete in under 10 seconds\n   - Use optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback\n   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms\n   ```tsx\n   // Connection status caching for user credentials\n   const useSupabaseConnectionStatus = (velocityProjectId) => {\n     const [status, setStatus] = useState({ isConnected: false, isLoading: true });\n     const statusCacheKey = `supabase-connection-${velocityProjectId}`;\n     \n     useEffect(() => {\n       // Try to get from cache first\n       const cachedStatus = sessionStorage.getItem(statusCacheKey);\n       if (cachedStatus) {\n         setStatus(JSON.parse(cachedStatus));\n       }\n       \n       // Then fetch fresh data\n       fetchConnectionStatus(velocityProjectId).then(freshStatus => {\n         setStatus(freshStatus);\n         sessionStorage.setItem(statusCacheKey, JSON.stringify(freshStatus));\n       });\n     }, [velocityProjectId]);\n     \n     return status;\n   };\n   ```\n\n7. **Security Considerations for Credential Storage**\n   - Implement strong AES-256 encryption for storing anon keys\n   - Use environment-specific encryption keys never stored in code\n   - Store connection metadata only, encrypt sensitive credentials\n   - Implement rate limiting on connection test endpoints\n   - Add proper logging for security auditing while respecting user privacy\n   - Ensure credentials can be updated or deleted by users at any time\n   ```tsx\n   // Secure credential encryption and storage\n   const encryptCredentials = async (credentials) => {\n     const encryptionKey = process.env.CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY;\n     const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);\n     const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey);\n     \n     const encryptedAnonKey = cipher.update(credentials.anonKey, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex');\n     \n     return {\n       projectUrl: credentials.url, // URLs are not sensitive\n       encryptedAnonKey,\n       encryptionIv: iv.toString('hex')\n     };\n   };\n   ```\n\n8. **Error Handling and User Experience**\n   - Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the connection flow\n   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting (respecting user privacy)\n   - Create user-friendly error messages for connection issues\n   - Set up monitoring for connection success rate\n   - Provide clear guidance on finding Supabase project credentials\n   ```tsx\n   try {\n     const result = await connectSupabaseProject(velocityProjectId, credentials);\n     logger.info(`Supabase connection successful for Velocity project ${velocityProjectId}`);\n     return result;\n   } catch (error) {\n     logger.error(`Supabase connection failed for Velocity project ${velocityProjectId}:`, error.message);\n     \n     if (error.message.includes('Invalid credentials')) {\n       throw new UserFacingError('Invalid Supabase credentials. Please check your project URL and anon key.');\n     } else if (error.message.includes('Network')) {\n       throw new UserFacingError('Network error connecting to Supabase. Please check your internet connection and try again.');\n     } else {\n       throw new UserFacingError('Failed to connect to Supabase project. Please verify your credentials and try again.');\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Data Sovereignty & User Control**:\n- Users maintain full ownership of their Supabase projects and data\n- Users control their own Supabase billing and resource limits\n- Velocity only connects to user's projects using provided credentials\n- Users can disconnect and update credentials at any time\n- All backend data remains in user's Supabase infrastructure\n- No partner registration or complex OAuth flows required",

Register Velocity as OAuth app in Supabase Dashboard\n   - Configure redirect URIs: `https://your-domain.com/auth/supabase/callback`\n   - Set required scopes: `organizations:read`, `projects:read`, `projects:write`, `secrets:read`\n\n2. **Environment Configuration**\n   ```typescript\n   // Additional environment variables for OAuth2\n   VITE_SUPABASE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth-client-id\n   VITE_SUPABASE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-oauth-client-secret  \n   VITE_SUPABASE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/auth/supabase/callback\n   VITE_SUPABASE_MANAGEMENT_API_URL=https://api.supabase.com/v1\n   ```\n\n3. **Database Schema Extensions**\n   ```sql\n   -- Extend existing supabase_connections table for OAuth\n   ALTER TABLE public.supabase_connections \n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS connection_method TEXT DEFAULT 'direct' \n     CHECK (connection_method IN ('direct', 'oauth')),\n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS oauth_organization_id TEXT,\n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS oauth_organization_slug TEXT,\n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS oauth_access_token TEXT, -- Encrypted\n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS oauth_refresh_token TEXT, -- Encrypted  \n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS oauth_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,\n   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS oauth_scopes TEXT[];\n   \n   -- OAuth state management (CSRF protection)\n   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.oauth_states (\n     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n     state_token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n     project_id UUID REFERENCES public.projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n     redirect_uri TEXT NOT NULL,\n     code_verifier TEXT, -- For PKCE\n     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),\n     expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '10 minutes'),\n     used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE\n   );\n   ```\n\n4. **OAuth2 Service Layer Interface**\n   ```typescript\n   // frontend/src/services/supabaseOAuthService.ts\n   interface SupabaseOAuth2Service {\n     // OAuth Flow\n     initiateOAuth(projectId: string, organizationSlug?: string): Promise<string>\n     handleCallback(code: string, state: string): Promise<OAuthTokens>\n     refreshToken(refreshToken: string): Promise<OAuthTokens>\n     \n     // Management API calls\n     getOrganizations(): Promise<SupabaseOrganization[]>\n     getProjects(organizationId?: string): Promise<SupabaseProject[]>\n     createProject(params: CreateSupabaseProjectRequest): Promise<SupabaseProject>\n     getProjectApiKeys(projectRef: string): Promise<ProjectApiKeys>\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis foundation enables both connection methods to coexist, giving users choice between direct credentials or OAuth2 integration.\n<info added on 2025-08-23T08:23:45.155Z>\n**Research-Based OAuth2 Implementation Updates**\n\nBased on official Supabase OAuth2 and Management API documentation research:\n\n**Updated OAuth2 Flow Configuration with PKCE**\n- Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) as recommended security practice\n- Generate code_verifier using crypto.getRandomValues() with SHA256 hashing\n- Store code_challenge in oauth_states table for verification\n- Authorization URL: `https://api.supabase.com/v1/oauth/authorize` with PKCE parameters\n\n**Management API Integration Details**\n- Base URL: `https://api.supabase.com/v1` (confirmed endpoint)\n- Key endpoints: `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/projects`, `/projects/{ref}/api-keys`\n- Authentication: Support both Personal Access Tokens and OAuth2 Bearer tokens\n- OAuth2 specifically designed for third-party applications managing projects on user's behalf\n\n**Required OAuth Scopes (Official)**\n- Auth scope: `auth:read auth:write` for authentication configuration\n- Projects scope: `projects:read projects:write` for project management\n- Organizations scope: `organizations:read` for organization access\n- Remove incorrect `secrets:read` scope - not documented in official API\n\n**Rate Limiting and Caching Implementation**\n- Official limit: 60 requests per minute per user\n- Implement request queuing with exponential backoff\n- Cache organization and project lists for 5-minute intervals\n- Add retry logic with proper error handling for 429 responses\n\n**Enhanced Security Requirements**\n- Mandatory HTTPS for all API requests\n- Token encryption using AES-256-GCM for database storage\n- Implement token rotation strategy with refresh tokens\n- Add proper CSRF protection using cryptographically secure state tokens\n- Validate redirect_uri against registered OAuth app configuration\n\n**Database Schema Corrections**\n- Add `oauth_token_encrypted_key` for AES encryption key storage\n- Include `last_token_refresh` timestamp for monitoring\n- Add `api_quota_remaining` and `quota_reset_time` for rate limiting\n- Create proper indexes on frequently queried OAuth columns\n\nThis enhancement provides secure OAuth2 integration alongside existing direct connections, following Supabase's official implementation guidelines.\n</info added on 2025-08-23T08:23:45.155Z>",

        "details": "## Implementation Details\n\n1. **Analyze Current Context Provider Architecture**\n   - Identify the existing ProjectProvider and SecurityProvider implementations\n   - Document the current state management approach and data flow\n   - Map out component remounting issues during navigation\n   - Measure current navigation performance metrics as baseline\n\n2. **Design Unified Context Provider System**\n   - Create a new `UnifiedProjectProvider` component that combines functionality:\n   ```tsx\n   // src/providers/UnifiedProjectProvider.tsx\n   import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';\n   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';\n   import { supabase } from '../lib/supabaseClient';\n   \n   interface UnifiedProjectContextType {\n     project: Project | null;\n     security: SecuritySettings | null;\n     loading: boolean;\n     error: Error | null;\n     refreshProject: () => Promise<void>;\n     updateSecurity: (settings: Partial<SecuritySettings>) => Promise<void>;\n     // Additional methods as needed\n   }\n   \n   const UnifiedProjectContext = createContext<UnifiedProjectContextType | undefined>(undefined);\n   \n   export const UnifiedProjectProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {\n     const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();\n     const [project, setProject] = useState<Project | null>(null);\n     const [security, setSecurity] = useState<SecuritySettings | null>(null);\n     const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);\n     const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);\n     \n     // Implement data fetching with caching\n     // ...\n     \n     const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({\n       project,\n       security,\n       loading,\n       error,\n       refreshProject,\n       updateSecurity,\n     }), [project, security, loading, error]);\n     \n     return (\n       <UnifiedProjectContext.Provider value={contextValue}>\n         {children}\n       </UnifiedProjectContext.Provider>\n     );\n   };\n   \n   export const useUnifiedProject = () => {\n     const context = useContext(UnifiedProjectContext);\n     if (context === undefined) {\n       throw new Error('useUnifiedProject must be used within a UnifiedProjectProvider');\n     }\n     return context;\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Implement State Caching Mechanism**\n   - Create a project state cache using React Context API\n   - Implement cache invalidation strategy based on project updates\n   - Add cache hit/miss tracking for performance monitoring\n   - Use localStorage for persistent caching between sessions:\n   ```tsx\n   // Cache implementation within UnifiedProjectProvider\n   const [cache, setCache] = useState<Record<string, CachedData>>(() => {\n     const savedCache = localStorage.getItem('projectCache');\n     return savedCache ? JSON.parse(savedCache) : {};\n   });\n   \n   useEffect(() => {\n     localStorage.setItem('projectCache', JSON.stringify(cache));\n   }, [cache]);\n   \n   const fetchProjectData = async (projectId: string) => {\n     // Check cache first\n     if (cache[projectId] && Date.now() - cache[projectId].timestamp < CACHE_TTL) {\n       setProject(cache[projectId].project);\n       setSecurity(cache[projectId].security);\n       setLoading(false);\n       return;\n     }\n     \n     // Fetch from API if not in cache\n     try {\n       setLoading(true);\n       const [projectData, securityData] = await Promise.all([\n         fetchProject(projectId),\n         fetchSecurity(projectId)\n       ]);\n       \n       setProject(projectData);\n       setSecurity(securityData);\n       \n       // Update cache\n       setCache(prev => ({\n         ...prev,\n         [projectId]: {\n           project: projectData,\n           security: securityData,\n           timestamp: Date.now()\n         }\n       }));\n     } catch (err) {\n       setError(err as Error);\n     } finally {\n       setLoading(false);\n     }\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Optimize API Call Reduction**\n   - Implement debounced API calls to prevent redundant requests\n   - Add conditional fetching based on data staleness\n   - Implement optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback\n   - Use React Query or SWR for advanced caching:\n   ```tsx\n   import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';\n   \n   // Within UnifiedProjectProvider\n   const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n   \n   const { data: projectData, isLoading: projectLoading } = useQuery(\n     ['project', id],\n     () => fetchProject(id as string),\n     {\n       staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes\n       cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes\n       enabled: !!id\n     }\n   );\n   \n   const updateProjectMutation = useMutation(\n     (updates: Partial<Project>) => updateProject(id as string, updates),\n     {\n       onMutate: async (newData) => {\n         // Optimistic update\n         await queryClient.cancelQueries(['project', id]);\n         const previousData = queryClient.getQueryData(['project', id]);\n         queryClient.setQueryData(['project', id], old => ({\n           ...old,\n           ...newData\n         }));\n         return { previousData };\n       },\n       onError: (err, newData, context) => {\n         // Roll back on error\n         queryClient.setQueryData(['project', id], context?.previousData);\n       },\n       onSettled: () => {\n         // Refetch to ensure consistency\n         queryClient.invalidateQueries(['project', id]);\n       }\n     }\n   );\n   ```\n\n5. **Implement Navigation Performance Optimizations**\n   - Add route-based code splitting for faster page loads\n   - Implement transition states to prevent UI flicker\n   - Use React.memo and useMemo for component optimization\n   - Add skeleton loaders for perceived performance improvement:\n   ```tsx\n   // In route components\n   import { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\n   \n   const ProjectDesign = lazy(() => import('./ProjectDesign'));\n   const ProjectEditor = lazy(() => import('./ProjectEditor'));\n   \n   // In router setup\n   <Route path=\"/project/:id\">\n     <UnifiedProjectProvider>\n       <Suspense fallback={<SkeletonLoader type=\"project\" />}>\n         <Route exact path=\"/project/:id\" component={ProjectDesign} />\n         <Route path=\"/project/:id/editor\" component={ProjectEditor} />\n       </Suspense>\n     </UnifiedProjectProvider>\n   </Route>\n   ```\n\n6. **Update Router Configuration**\n   - Modify the application router to use the UnifiedProjectProvider\n   - Ensure the provider wraps both project routes\n   - Implement shallow routing for navigation between pages\n   - Add route transition animations for smoother UX:\n   ```tsx\n   // src/App.tsx or router configuration\n   import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\n   import { UnifiedProjectProvider } from './providers/UnifiedProjectProvider';\n   import { AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';\n   \n   function App() {\n     return (\n       <BrowserRouter>\n         <Routes>\n           {/* Other routes */}\n           <Route \n             path=\"/project/:id/*\" \n             element={\n               <UnifiedProjectProvider>\n                 <AnimatePresence mode=\"wait\">\n                   <Routes>\n                     <Route path=\"/\" element={<ProjectDesign />} />\n                     <Route path=\"/editor\" element={<ProjectEditor />} />\n                   </Routes>\n                 </AnimatePresence>\n               </UnifiedProjectProvider>\n             } \n           />\n         </Routes>\n       </BrowserRouter>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. **Refactor Existing Components**\n   -

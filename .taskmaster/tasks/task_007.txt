# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement EAS Build Integration for Native App Compilation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with Expo Application Services (EAS) for native app compilation, build status tracking, and artifact management.
# Details:
1. Set up EAS Build integration:
   - Configure EAS CLI and API access
   - Create build profiles for iOS and Android
   - Implement build configuration management
   - Handle app.json and eas.json generation
2. Develop build queue management:
   - Build request creation and submission
   - Build status tracking via webhooks
   - Build cancellation and prioritization
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Implement build artifact management:
   - Store build outputs in Supabase Storage
   - Generate download links for artifacts
   - Track build history and versions
   - Manage build logs for debugging
4. Create webhook endpoint for EAS build status updates:
   - /build-webhook Edge Function
   - Real-time status updates via Supabase Realtime
   - Build failure analysis and reporting
5. Add build configuration templates for common scenarios

Technology recommendations:
- EAS Build API v3
- Expo SDK 50+
- Supabase Storage for artifact management
- Supabase Edge Functions for webhook handling
- Expo Updates for OTA update support

# Test Strategy:
1. Test build initiation for iOS and Android platforms
2. Validate build status tracking and webhook functionality
3. Test artifact storage and retrieval
4. Verify build configuration generation
5. Test build cancellation and error handling
6. Validate build logs capture and display
7. Test concurrent build handling and queuing
8. Verify build performance metrics collection

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure EAS CLI and API Access [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure EAS CLI with proper authentication and API access for the project
### Details:
Install EAS CLI using npm or yarn. Create an Expo account if not already available. Configure authentication using 'eas login' command. Generate and store API tokens securely in environment variables. Set up project-specific EAS configuration. Implement credential management for iOS and Android builds. Create helper functions for EAS API interactions. Document the setup process for team members.

## 2. Create Build Profiles for iOS and Android [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop and configure build profiles for both iOS and Android platforms with appropriate settings
### Details:
Create eas.json file with development, preview, and production build profiles for both iOS and Android. Configure iOS-specific settings including provisioning profiles, certificates, and App Store Connect team ID. Set up Android-specific configurations including keystore settings and Play Store credentials. Implement environment-specific variables for each build profile. Create a UI for managing and selecting build profiles. Develop validation logic for build profile configurations. Implement profile templates for common use cases.

## 3. Implement Build Queue Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Develop a system to manage build requests, track status, handle cancellations, and implement retry mechanisms
### Details:
Create a build queue database schema in Supabase. Implement build request creation and submission to EAS API. Develop build status tracking using EAS API polling and webhooks. Create UI components for displaying build queue and status. Implement build cancellation functionality. Add build prioritization for premium users. Develop error handling with automatic and manual retry options. Create logging system for build process events. Implement concurrency limits based on subscription tier.

## 4. Develop Build Artifact Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a system to store, organize, and provide access to build artifacts in Supabase Storage
### Details:
Set up Supabase Storage buckets for build artifacts. Implement secure upload of build artifacts from EAS to Supabase Storage. Create metadata schema for tracking build versions and artifacts. Generate time-limited download links for artifacts. Implement artifact retention policies based on subscription tier. Develop UI for browsing and downloading build history. Create build artifact cleanup routines for old builds. Implement build logs storage and retrieval for debugging.

## 5. Create Webhook Endpoint for EAS Build Status Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement a webhook endpoint to receive and process real-time build status updates from EAS
### Details:
Create a Supabase Edge Function for the /build-webhook endpoint. Implement webhook signature verification for security. Process incoming build status updates and store in database. Set up real-time notifications using Supabase Realtime. Develop build failure analysis to categorize and report issues. Create alert system for critical build failures. Implement detailed logging for webhook events. Set up monitoring for webhook reliability. Create documentation for webhook payload structure and handling.

## 6. Implement Build Configuration Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create and manage reusable build configuration templates for common scenarios
### Details:
Design a template schema for storing build configurations. Create default templates for common scenarios (e.g., production iOS, development Android). Implement template selection UI in the build process. Develop template customization and saving functionality. Create template sharing between team members. Implement template versioning and change tracking. Add template validation to prevent misconfiguration. Develop documentation for each template type with best practices.

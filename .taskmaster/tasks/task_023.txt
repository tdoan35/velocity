# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Block-Based PRD Editor Architecture with Section-Aware Saving
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the existing PRD Editor components to use a block-based architecture with structured sections, enabling section-aware auto-saving and maintaining proper data schema throughout the editing flow. Build upon existing NotionPRDEditor, SectionEditor, and edge functions. Enhanced with Notion-like UI/UX features for optimal editing experience.

## Implementation Details

1. **Refactor Existing SectionEditor to SectionBlock Base**
   - Extend the existing SectionEditor component to serve as the foundation SectionBlock for all section types
   - Add data attributes (`data-section-id`, `data-field`) to maintain structure during editing
   - Implement section-specific validation using Zod schemas
   ```tsx
   interface SectionBlockProps {
     id: string;
     type: SectionType;
     content: any;
     ownership: AgentType;
     isRequired: boolean;
     onUpdate: (id: string, content: any) => void;
   }
   ```

2. **Enhance NotionPRDEditor for Section-Aware Operations**
   - Refactor the existing NotionPRDEditor with TipTap to use section-aware saving instead of full document saves
   - Integrate with existing edge functions (updateSection, addSection) for granular operations
   - Implement debounced section-level saves using existing backend infrastructure
   ```typescript
   const debouncedSaveSection = useCallback(
     debounce((sectionId: string, content: any) => {
       // Use existing updateSection edge function
       updateSection(projectId, prdId, sectionId, content);
     }, 1500),
     [projectId, prdId]
   );
   ```

3. **Section Data Schema Implementation**
   - Define Zod schemas for each section type to ensure data integrity with existing JSONB sections column
   ```typescript
   const OverviewSectionSchema = z.object({
     vision: z.string(),
     problem: z.string(),
     targetUsers: z.array(z.string())
   });
   ```
   - Create type definitions and validation utilities that work with existing database structure

4. **Enhance Existing BlockControls and DragHandle Components**
   - Extend existing BlockControls to include section-specific actions
   - Enhance existing DragHandle with constraint logic to prevent deletion of required sections
   - Add visual indicators for drag targets and invalid drops
   - Implement slash command menu integration with existing components

5. **Section Ownership and Permissions Enhancement**
   - Add visual badges to existing components to indicate agent ownership of sections
   - Implement permission logic using existing database schema
   - Create section visibility controls for hiding/showing sections

6. **Smart Paste Detection Integration**
   - Implement content transformation within existing TipTap editor setup
   ```typescript
   const handlePaste = (e: ClipboardEvent, sectionType: SectionType) => {
     const text = e.clipboardData?.getData('text/plain');
     if (!text) return;
     
     // Transform content based on section type using existing infrastructure
     switch (sectionType) {
       case 'features':
         // Parse as feature list if possible
         break;
       case 'overview':
         // Parse as overview content
         break;
     }
   };
   ```

7. **Migration and Backward Compatibility**
   - Ensure existing PRDs in the database work with the refactored components
   - Implement any necessary data migrations for the sections JSONB column
   - Create fallback rendering for legacy section formats

8. **Integration Testing with Existing Backend**
   - Verify compatibility with existing edge functions (updateSection, addSection, etc.)
   - Test section operations against existing database schema
   - Ensure proper integration with existing authentication and permissions

9. **Notion-like UI/UX Integration**
   - Create NotionSectionEditor component wrapping TipTap while maintaining section-aware architecture
   - Implement hybrid content model storing both structured data (for backend) and rich HTML (for display)
   - Add slash command menu (/) for quick content insertion with section-specific commands
   - Implement bubble menu for contextual text formatting
   - Enhance BlockControls with improved drag handles and visual feedback
   - Apply Notion-style CSS with clean aesthetics and proper spacing
   - Add placeholder text with helpful hints for each section type
   - Implement smooth animations for interactions and transitions
   - Add block hover effects for visual feedback during editing
   - Enable inline editing without modal dialogs for seamless experience

# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement GitHub Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop two-way synchronization between Velocity projects and GitHub repositories with commit management and branch support.
# Details:
1. Set up GitHub API integration:
   - OAuth authentication for repository access
   - Repository creation and configuration
   - Webhook setup for change notifications
   - Permission management and scopes
2. Implement repository synchronization:
   - Initial repository creation from project
   - File synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Commit generation for project changes
   - Pull latest changes from GitHub
3. Develop branch management:
   - Branch creation and switching
   - Merge operations with conflict resolution
   - Branch protection rules configuration
   - Pull request creation and tracking
4. Add commit history visualization:
   - Commit timeline with author information
   - Diff viewer for code changes
   - Commit message generation and editing
   - Blame view for file history
5. Implement repository export for migration

Technology recommendations:
- GitHub REST API v3 and GraphQL API v4
- Octokit.js for GitHub API interaction
- Simple Git for local git operations
- Diff visualization libraries (e.g., diff2html)
- Monaco Editor diff extension

# Test Strategy:
1. Test GitHub repository creation and initialization
2. Validate two-way synchronization with various change patterns
3. Test branch creation, switching, and merging
4. Verify conflict resolution during synchronization
5. Test pull request creation and management
6. Validate commit history visualization
7. Test repository export functionality
8. Verify performance with large repositories

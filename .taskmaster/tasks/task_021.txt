   - Implement version tagging functionality (e.g., "Draft", "Review", "Approved")

2. **Collaborative Editing Infrastructure**
   - Integrate a real-time collaboration library such as Yjs or ShareDB
   - Implement operational transformation or CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) for conflict resolution
   - Set up WebSocket connections for real-time updates between collaborators
   - Create presence indicators showing active users and their cursor positions
   - Implement user-specific highlighting for changes with attribution

3. **Version History UI Components**
   - Create a version history sidebar/modal showing all saved versions with timestamps and authors
   - Implement version restoration functionality to revert to previous versions
   - Develop a visual diff viewer to compare any two versions with additions/deletions highlighted
   - Add version filtering and search capabilities
   - Implement version annotations for adding context to specific versions

4. **Collaborative Editing UI Components**
   - Develop user avatars and presence indicators in the editor
   - Create a collaborator list showing all active users
   - Implement cursor and selection synchronization between users
   - Add user-specific color coding for changes and selections
   - Create a changes feed showing recent edits by collaborators

5. **Permission System for Collaborative Editing**
   - Implement role-based permissions (viewer, editor, admin)
   - Create invitation system for adding collaborators to a PRD
   - Develop locking mechanisms for sections to prevent simultaneous editing conflicts
   - Add commenting functionality for feedback without direct editing
   - Implement approval workflows for version finalization

6. **Offline Support and Conflict Resolution**
   - Implement offline editing capabilities with local storage
   - Develop intelligent merge strategies for resolving conflicts on reconnection
   - Create conflict resolution UI for manual resolution when needed
   - Implement change queuing for offline edits
   - Add sync status indicators showing connection state

7. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement efficient data structures for version history storage
   - Use incremental updates for real-time collaboration to minimize bandwidth
   - Optimize rendering performance for the diff viewer with virtualization
   - Implement lazy loading for version history
   - Add caching strategies for frequently accessed versions

8. **Integration with Existing PRD Editor**
   - Connect version history and collaborative editing features to the TipTap editor
   - Ensure compatibility with the existing PRD section navigation
   - Integrate with the PRD status indicator component
   - Update the PRD service to support version history and collaboration
   - Ensure the export functionality works with version history

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing Version History System**
   - Test version creation with various change scenarios
   - Verify diff generation between versions is accurate
   - Test version restoration functionality
   - Validate version metadata storage and retrieval
   - Test version tagging and filtering capabilities

2. **Integration Testing for Collaborative Editing**
   - Test real-time updates between multiple simulated users
   - Verify conflict resolution in various editing scenarios
   - Test WebSocket connection handling, including disconnection and reconnection
   - Validate cursor and selection synchronization
   - Test presence indicators and user attribution

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark version history storage and retrieval with large documents
   - Test collaborative editing performance with multiple simultaneous users
   - Measure network bandwidth usage during collaborative sessions
   - Test rendering performance of the diff viewer with large changes
   - Validate lazy loading implementation for version history

4. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Create test scenarios for common collaborative workflows
   - Test the user experience of resolving conflicts
   - Validate the intuitiveness of the version history UI
   - Test the visibility and usefulness of presence indicators
   - Verify the clarity of change attribution in the document

5. **Cross-browser and Device Testing**
   - Test collaborative features across different browsers
   - Verify mobile responsiveness of version history and collaboration UI
   - Test offline capabilities on various devices
   - Validate WebSocket compatibility across platforms
   - Test performance on lower-powered devices

6. **Security Testing**
   - Verify permission enforcement for different user roles
   - Test invitation system security
   - Validate that users can only see versions they have permission to access
   - Test for potential data leakage in collaborative sessions
   - Verify authentication integration with collaborative features

7. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Create automated tests simulating multiple users collaborating
   - Test the full lifecycle of document creation, collaboration, and version management
   - Verify integration with the existing PRD editor components
   - Test export functionality with version history
   - Validate that all collaborative features work together cohesively

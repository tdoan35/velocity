## Implementation Details

1. **Extend Project Manager Agent Capabilities**
   - Modify the existing Project Manager agent to include PRD creation functionality
   - Define a structured PRD template with sections for overview, core features (minimum 3), and additional features
   - Implement conversation flow states to track progress through PRD creation process

2. **Develop Conversational Guidance System**
   - Create a state machine to track the PRD creation progress (initialization, overview, core features, additional features, review)
   - Implement contextual prompts for each section to elicit appropriate information
   - Design follow-up questions to refine and expand user inputs
   - Add validation logic to ensure minimum requirements are met (e.g., at least 3 core features)
   - Store PRD creation progress in the database to allow for multi-session creation

3. **Implement Suggested Responses Feature**
   - Create a component to display 3 clickable response options after each agent message
   - Develop a system to generate contextually relevant response suggestions based on:
     - Current PRD section being discussed
     - Previous user inputs and conversation history
     - Common patterns and best practices for PRD content
   - Implement click handlers to insert selected suggestions into the chat input
   - Add visual styling to make suggestions stand out but not overwhelm the interface

4. **PRD Storage and Integration**
   - Create database schema extensions to store PRD content with project metadata
   - Implement versioning to track PRD evolution over time
   - Develop export functionality to generate formatted PRD documents (Markdown, PDF)
   - Create API endpoints to share PRD data with downstream agents:
     - Design Assistant for UI/UX planning
     - Engineering Assistant for technical architecture
     - Config Helper for backend/integrations

5. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add progress indicators to show completion status of PRD sections
   - Implement inline previews of the PRD as it's being created
   - Create a summary view that highlights missing or incomplete sections
   - Add contextual help and examples for each PRD section

6. **Integration with Vercel AI SDK**
   - Leverage streaming responses for real-time feedback during PRD creation
   - Implement specialized prompt templates for PRD guidance
   - Use function calling capabilities to structure PRD data extraction from conversations

# Test Strategy:
## Test Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test PRD state machine transitions with various input scenarios
   - Verify suggested responses generation logic with different conversation contexts
   - Validate PRD validation rules (e.g., minimum 3 core features requirement)
   - Test database operations for storing and retrieving PRD content

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify Project Manager agent correctly integrates with Vercel AI SDK
   - Test PRD data sharing with downstream agents (Design, Engineering, Config)
   - Validate PRD export functionality in different formats
   - Test multi-session PRD creation with conversation persistence

3. **User Experience Testing**
   - Conduct usability testing with different user personas:
     - Technical users with clear product vision
     - Non-technical users needing more guidance
     - Users with partial PRD information
   - Test the suggested responses feature with various conversation flows
   - Verify that clickable suggestions correctly insert content into the chat

4. **Conversation Flow Testing**
   - Create test scripts that simulate complete PRD creation journeys
   - Test edge cases where users provide minimal or excessive information
   - Verify agent's ability to guide conversation back on track when it diverges
   - Test agent's handling of ambiguous or contradictory requirements

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure response time for suggested options generation
   - Test system performance with large PRDs and extended conversation histories
   - Verify PRD creation process works efficiently across different devices and browsers

6. **Acceptance Testing**
   - Verify final PRD output meets all requirements:
     - Contains overview section
     - Includes at least 3 core features
     - Has additional features section
     - Properly formatted and structured
   - Validate that downstream agents can successfully consume the PRD data

# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Project Design Page with AI Chat Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 10, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an AI chat interface that appears after users submit their app design prompt, including project creation, routing to a project-specific page, and implementing real-time chat functionality for design iteration.
# Details:
1. Implement project creation and database integration:
   - Create a new database table/schema for storing project design prompts and chat history
   - Implement API endpoint for creating a new project when a prompt is submitted
   - Store initial prompt, project metadata, and timestamps in Supabase
   - Generate unique project IDs for routing and reference

2. Develop project-specific routing:
   - Set up dynamic routing with React Router for `/project/:projectId` paths
   - Implement route guards to verify project access permissions
   - Create loading states and error handling for invalid project IDs
   - Add project metadata to page title and browser history

3. Design and implement chat interface:
   - Create a responsive chat UI with message bubbles for user and AI
   - Display the original prompt as the first message in the conversation
   - Implement message composition with markdown support
   - Add typing indicators and loading states for AI responses
   - Support code blocks with syntax highlighting using Monaco Editor components
   - Implement message timestamps and read receipts

4. Integrate real-time functionality:
   - Set up Supabase Realtime subscriptions for chat messages
   - Implement optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - Create message queue for handling network interruptions
   - Add presence indicators for collaborative sessions
   - Implement message delivery confirmation

5. Develop AI integration for design assistance:
   - Connect to OpenAI API for generating design responses
   - Implement context assembly with project details and chat history
   - Create specialized prompts for app design assistance
   - Add support for design iterations and refinements
   - Implement vector similarity search to reference similar designs
   - Cache common design patterns for performance optimization

6. Add design visualization capabilities:
   - Generate UI mockups based on design descriptions
   - Implement component previews for suggested UI elements
   - Create visual design system references
   - Support image uploads and references in the chat

7. Implement session management:
   - Track active design sessions
   - Add auto-save functionality for draft messages
   - Implement session timeout and recovery
   - Create session persistence across page reloads

# Test Strategy:
1. Test project creation and database integration:
   - Verify new projects are correctly created in the database when prompts are submitted
   - Test project ID generation for uniqueness and format
   - Validate all required metadata is stored correctly
   - Test error handling for failed project creation

2. Validate routing and navigation:
   - Test navigation to `/project/:projectId` with valid and invalid IDs
   - Verify proper loading states and error messages
   - Test browser history and navigation between projects
   - Validate URL sharing functionality

3. Test chat interface functionality:
   - Verify original prompt appears as first message
   - Test message composition and submission
   - Validate markdown rendering and code block formatting
   - Test UI responsiveness across device sizes
   - Verify typing indicators and loading states

4. Test real-time capabilities:
   - Verify messages appear in real-time across multiple clients
   - Test optimistic UI updates and conflict resolution
   - Validate message queue behavior during network interruptions
   - Test presence indicators for accuracy
   - Measure performance with multiple concurrent users

5. Validate AI integration:
   - Test AI response quality for design prompts
   - Verify context assembly with project history
   - Test response times and optimization
   - Validate design iteration capabilities
   - Test vector similarity search accuracy

6. Test design visualization:
   - Verify UI mockup generation quality
   - Test component preview rendering
   - Validate design system references
   - Test image upload and display functionality

7. Perform end-to-end testing:
   - Complete full design workflows from prompt to final design
   - Test with various prompt types and complexity levels
   - Validate session persistence across page reloads
   - Test with simulated network conditions

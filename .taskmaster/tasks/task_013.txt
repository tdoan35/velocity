# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Project Management and Collaboration Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement project CRUD operations, file management, and real-time collaboration features using Supabase Realtime with professional development capabilities for team coordination and version control.
# Details:
1. Create advanced project management system:
   - Project creation, reading, updating, and deletion
   - Project metadata management (name, description, created_by, etc.)
   - Project templates for common app patterns (React SPA, Next.js, Mobile App)
   - Project export as ZIP file with full structure
   - Project sharing with permission levels (view/edit/admin)
2. Implement comprehensive file management system:
   - File tree structure with folders and path-based navigation
   - File creation, editing, deletion operations
   - File versioning with rollback capabilities and history tracking
   - File type detection and appropriate handling
   - Path-based file organization with JSONB storage in Supabase
3. Set up real-time collaboration using Supabase Realtime:
   - Operational transformation for conflict resolution in simultaneous editing
   - Live collaborative editing with conflict resolution
   - User presence indicators with cursor position tracking
   - Real-time file synchronization across all collaborators
4. Add comprehensive commenting and code review system:
   - Line-specific comments for code review
   - Comment threads with replies and resolution tracking
   - Comment persistence and real-time updates
   - Feedback system integration
5. Implement activity feeds tracking all project changes:
   - File modifications, additions, deletions
   - Comment additions and resolutions
   - User join/leave events
   - Permission changes and sharing events
6. Add professional development coordination features:
   - Version control integration preparation
   - Team coordination tools
   - Project access management

Technology requirements:
- Supabase Realtime with Broadcast and Presence channels
- Operational Transformation library (yjs or similar)
- Path-based file system abstractions
- JSONB storage for file organization
- JSZip for project export functionality
- Monaco Editor collaboration extensions
- Real-time conflict resolution algorithms

# Test Strategy:
1. Test project CRUD operations with various project sizes and templates
2. Validate file management across different file types with versioning
3. Test real-time collaboration with multiple concurrent users (5-10 users)
4. Verify operational transformation and conflict resolution in simultaneous editing
5. Test comment system functionality, persistence, and real-time updates
6. Validate activity feed accuracy and real-time performance
7. Test project export and import functionality with large projects
8. Verify performance with large projects (1000+ files)
9. Test project sharing with different permission levels
10. Validate user presence indicators and cursor tracking accuracy
11. Test rollback capabilities and version history navigation
12. Verify path-based file organization with JSONB queries

# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Single Source of Truth Architecture with TipTap JSON
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24.1 (Not found), 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the sections array to be the only source of truth for PRD content, replacing HTML string storage with TipTap's JSON document structure and implementing unidirectional data flow.
# Details:
- Refactor the sections array to be the only source of truth for PRD content
- Remove any duplicate state representations (e.g., HTML strings alongside section data)
- Implement clear unidirectional data flow: Sections Data → Section State → Editor View
- Replace HTML string storage with TipTap's JSON document structure
- Create custom TipTap nodes for different section types
- Implement serialization/deserialization between JSON and editor state

This is the primary fix based on investigation findings, implementing the comprehensive solution to address the root cause of content duplication. The task now serves as the first implementation step that directly targets the TipTap editor content clearing issue identified during investigation. Key improvements include proper use of editor.commands.clearContent(false) before setContent() to prevent DOM node retention, complete elimination of HTML string storage in favor of TipTap's JSON document structure, and establishment of strict unidirectional data flow to prevent content accumulation during save/reload cycles.

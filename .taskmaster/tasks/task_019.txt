## Implementation Details

1. **Automatic Initial Prompt Submission**
   - Modify `ProjectDesign.tsx` to automatically submit the user's initial app idea prompt when they first visit the project design page
   - Implement a loading state during automatic submission to provide visual feedback
   - Add logic to detect if this is the first visit to the project design page
   - Store submission status in local state and Supabase to prevent duplicate submissions

2. **Project Context Maintenance**
   - Update `useAIChatStream.ts` to include project context in all conversation requests:
   ```typescript
   // Add project context to chat parameters
   const fetchChatStream = async (messages: Message[], projectId: string) => {
     const projectContext = await getProjectContext(projectId);
     return fetch('/api/chat', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         messages,
         projectContext, // Include full project context
       }),
     });
   };
   ```
   - Create a `getProjectContext` function in `conversationService.ts` that retrieves:
     - Initial project prompt
     - Project metadata (name, description, created date)
     - Key project decisions and milestones
     - Technology stack selections
   - Implement caching for project context to improve performance

3. **System Prompt Enhancement**
   - Modify the conversation edge function to incorporate project context into system prompts:
   ```typescript
   // Edge function enhancement
   export default async function handler(req: Request) {
     const { messages, projectContext } = await req.json();
     
     // Create enhanced system prompt with project context
     const systemPrompt = `
       You are assisting with a project with the following context:
       Initial Idea: ${projectContext.initialPrompt}
       Project Name: ${projectContext.name}
       Project Description: ${projectContext.description}
       Key Decisions: ${projectContext.keyDecisions.join(', ')}
       
       Keep all responses aligned with this project vision and context.
     `;
     
     // Add system prompt to beginning of message array
     const enhancedMessages = [
       { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
       ...messages
     ];
     
     // Continue with existing OpenAI/Anthropic call logic
   }
   ```

4. **AI Agent Awareness**
   - Update all AI agent implementations to reference the original project vision
   - Modify agent selection logic to pass project context to each specialized agent
   - Implement a context verification step where agents validate that their responses align with project goals
   - Add a project context summary component that's visible to users during conversations

5. **Persistence and State Management**
   - Ensure project context is persisted in Supabase for long-term storage
   - Implement client-side state management to maintain context during the session
   - Use React Context API to make project context available throughout the application
   - Add middleware to API routes to automatically attach project context to requests

6. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**
   - Implement robust error handling for cases where project context can't be retrieved
   - Create fallback mechanisms to continue conversations with limited context
   - Add logging for context-related errors to identify potential issues
   - Implement retry logic for failed context retrievals

# Test Strategy:
## Test Strategy

1. **Automatic Prompt Submission Testing**
   - Verify that the initial prompt is automatically submitted when a new user visits the project design page
   - Test with various prompt lengths and content types
   - Validate that duplicate submissions are prevented
   - Test error handling when automatic submission fails

2. **Project Context Persistence**
   - Create test fixtures with various project contexts
   - Verify that project context is correctly retrieved and included in all conversation requests
   - Test context retrieval performance with different project sizes
   - Validate that context is maintained when navigating between different pages

3. **System Prompt Integration**
   - Use mock API responses to verify that system prompts correctly incorporate project context
   - Test with various project contexts to ensure proper formatting
   - Validate that the enhanced system prompts produce responses aligned with project goals
   - Perform A/B testing comparing responses with and without project context

4. **End-to-End Flow Testing**
   - Create test scenarios covering the complete user journey:
     - Initial project creation
     - First automatic conversation
     - Subsequent manual conversations
     - Context maintenance across sessions
   - Test with different user personas and project types
   - Validate that AI responses remain consistent with project vision

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure impact of context inclusion on API response times
   - Test caching mechanisms for project context
   - Verify performance with large project contexts
   - Optimize context size if performance issues are detected

6. **Cross-Browser and Device Testing**
   - Test the enhanced flow across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify functionality on mobile devices
   - Test with different network conditions (fast, slow, intermittent)
   - Validate accessibility of the enhanced user flow

# Velocity - AI-Powered Mobile App Development Platform
## Engineering-Focused Product Requirements Document

---

## Overview

Velocity is an AI-first mobile app development platform that transforms natural language descriptions into production-ready React Native applications. The platform eliminates the traditional barriers of mobile development by providing conversational code generation, real-time device preview, and seamless deployment to app stores.

**Problem Statement**: Building mobile apps requires extensive technical expertise, long development cycles, and complex toolchain management. Non-technical entrepreneurs and even experienced developers face significant friction getting from idea to deployed mobile application.

**Solution**: Velocity provides a browser-based IDE with AI-powered code generation, real-time mobile preview via Appetize.io, and one-click deployment through Expo Application Services (EAS). Users can build, preview, and deploy React Native apps using natural language conversations with Claude AI.

**Target Users**:
- **Primary**: Non-technical entrepreneurs validating mobile app ideas
- **Secondary**: Product managers creating rapid prototypes
- **Tertiary**: React Native developers accelerating project setup and feature development

**Value Proposition**: From idea to App Store deployment in minutes, not months, with production-quality React Native code that users own and can extend.

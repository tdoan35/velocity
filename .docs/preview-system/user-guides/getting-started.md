# Getting Started with Velocity Preview

Welcome to Velocity's real-time mobile preview system! This guide will help you get up and running with previewing your React Native applications on real devices in minutes.

## What is Velocity Preview?

Velocity Preview allows you to see your React Native application running on real iOS and Android devices directly in your browser. Changes you make to your code are instantly reflected in the preview through hot reloading.

### Step 2: Launch Preview
